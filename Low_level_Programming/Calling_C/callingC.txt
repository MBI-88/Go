The compress/... subtree of the standard library provides compressors and decompressors
for popular compression algorithms, including LZW (used by the Unix compress command)
and DEFLATE (used by the GNU gzip command). The APIs of these packages vary slightly
in details, but they all provide a wrapper for an io.Writer that compresses the data written to
it, and a wrapper for an io.Reader that decompresses the data read from it. For example:

package gzip // compress/gzip
func NewWriter(w io.Writer) io.WriteCloser
func NewReader(r io.Reader) (io.ReadCloser, error)
