	Notice that the third shout from the client is not dealt with until the second shout has petered
	out, which is not very realistic. A real echo would consist of the composition of the three independent 
	shouts. To simulate it, weâ€™ll need more goroutines. Again, all we need to do is add
	the go keyword , this time to the call to echo.
