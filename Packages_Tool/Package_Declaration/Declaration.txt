A Go source file may contain zero or more import declarations immediately after the package
declaration and before the first non-import declaration. Each import declaration may specify
the import path of a single package, or multiple packages in a parenthesized list. The two
forms below are equivalent but the second form is more common.

import "fmt"
import "os"
import (
"fmt"
"os"
)

If we need to import two packages whose names are the same, like math/rand and
crypto/rand, into a third package, the import declaration must specify an alternative name
for at least one of them to avoid a conflict. This is called a renaming import.
import (
    "crypto/rand"
    mrand "math/rand" // alternative name mrand avoids conflict
)
