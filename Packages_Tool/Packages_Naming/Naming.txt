Avoid package names that already have other connotations. For example, we originally used
the name temp for the temperature conversion package in Section 2.5, but that didn’t last long.
It was a terrible idea because ‘‘temp’’ is an almost universal synonym for ‘‘temp orary.’’ We went
through a brief period with the name temperature, but that was too long and didn’t say what
the package did. In the end, it became tempconv, which is shorter and parallel with strconv.
Now let’s turn to the naming of package members. Since each reference to a member of
another package uses a qualified identifier such as fmt.Println, the burden of describing the
package member is borne equally by the package name and the member name. We need not
mention the concept of for matting in Println because the package name fmt does that
already. When designing a package, con sider how the two parts of a qualified identifier work
together, not the member name alone. Here are some characteristic examples:
bytes.Equal flag.Int http.Get json.Marshal
