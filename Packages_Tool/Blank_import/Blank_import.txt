It is an error to import a package into a file but not refer to the name it defines within that file.
However, on occasion we must import a package merely for the side effects of doing so: evaluation of 
the initializer expressions of its package-level variables and execution of its init functions (§2.6.2). 
To suppress the ‘‘unused import’’ error we would otherwise encounter, we must
use a renaming import in which the alternative name is _, the blank identifier. As  blank identifier can never be referenced.
import _ "image/png" // register PNG decoder
