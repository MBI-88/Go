Each package serves as a separate name space for its declarations. Within the image package,
for example, the identifier Decode refers to a different function than does the same identifier
in the unicode/utf16 package. To refer to a function from outside its package, we must
qualify the identifier to make explicit whether we mean image.Decode or utf16.Decode.

Packages also let us hide information by controlling which names are visible outside the package, or expor ted. 
In Go, a simple rule governs which identifiers are exported and which are
not: exported identifiers start with an upp er-case letter.
